# Chess-AI-Alpha-Beta-Pruning-with-Killer-Heuristic-Optimization
My final project (Bachelor of Computer Science):
Implementation of Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm with Killer Heuristic Optimization in Artificial Intelligence of Chess Game

This project is used to research about the comparison of Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm without optimization and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm with Killer Heuristic optimization in chess game.

The measured variables is the speed of time and the number of nodes made by each algorithm from depth 2 to 5.

Research result:
Killer Heuristic optimization is faster and make fewer nodes than Alpha-Beta Pruning without optimization.
But, Killer Heuristic optimization is more unstable than Alpha-Beta Pruning without optimization.
